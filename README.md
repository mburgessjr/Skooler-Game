# Skooler-Game
A short game made in Javascript merely for fun.

Green fish are enemies, yellow fish are prey. To move the hero, simple arrow keys are employed.

Coming into contact with yellow fish increases size of the orange hero fish, whereas green fish decrease size. Increase in size is directly correlated to increase in score.

Approximately half of fish will be friendly and seek out the hero fish, yet the other half will act shy and move away from the hero.
